# EECS 731 Project 7

This is Andre Kurait's seventh project for EECS 731, Data Science in Fall 2019.
For this project, I created visualizations for data from soccer matches.

## Project Requirements
Great stories and great visual effects
1. Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Download any of the data sets from previous projects
3. Load the data set into panda data frames
4. Formulate one or two ideas on how storytelling and visualization would help describe the data set and establish additional value
5. Build three or more compelling visualizations
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub

## Project structure
```bash

├── Data

├── README.md
└── Storytelling.ipynb
```

## Data Set
For this project I used the soccer matches data set from the fourth project.
This data set can be found at: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-api/club/spi_matches.csv

## Conclusion
Overall, I am very happy with the visualizations that I created with seaborn. I learned a lot about how to create compelling visualizations.
